## Problem

### List as part of a tuple

Listen

A tuple can hold elements of various types, including lists, which makes tuples versatile for storing a mix of different data structures.

Consider the syntax below

```
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = ("Alice", 30, my_list)

print("Tuple:", my_tuple)   # Output - Tuple: ('Alice', 30, [1, 2, 3])

```

### Task

Consider the tuple defined as follows

```
student = ("Alice", 20, ["Math", "Science", "English"])

```

What will be the output for `print(student[2])`?

```
