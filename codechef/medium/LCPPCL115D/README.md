## Problem

### Print powers of 2

Listen

### Task

You have to print powers of $2$ from $2$ to $128$ in separate lines using a while loop:

- When using a loop you have to think about three things initialization, condition and update statement.
- So think about what we initialize the variable with? i.e., Where does the sequence start form?
- Think about what the condition will be? i.e., Till where is the sequence going?
- Also think about how the variable will be updating after every iteration. How the terms in the sequence are changing?
### Expected Output

```

8
16
32
64
128

```
